                     Tango Database server README
                     ============================
 
This file contains information on installing/upgrading the Tango database
server. This guide assumes that a MySQL daemon runs on the machine you
want to install the database and that the DB server has history capabilities
(Release_2_9 or higher).
Note: You need jive 3.3 or higher to be able to access history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from scratch
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Launch the mysql client

mysql -u[user] -p[password]

#Create the tango scheme, add the declaration of the DB server and
#initialise history tables.

mysql>source tango_create.sql

# Set-up the environment variables MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD
# or prepare the my.cnf (mysql configuration file) file to specify 
# the mysql user and its password to be used to connect to the database.

# The user is root without a password
export MYSQL_USER=root

#Now, you should be able to launch the DB server

Databaseds 2 -ORBendPoint giop:tcp:[hostname]:[port]

#To test if the DB server is working fine, you can launch jive

export TANGO_HOST=[hostname]:[port]
jive


------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to upgrade the DB scheme. This section descrbies what you have to do 
if you already use a DB server running with an old scheme (without history 
tables)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Launch the mysql client

mysql -u[user] -p[password]

#Check if the database scheme has already history tables

mysql>show tables;

#If the scheme already has history tables, you should see the 6 following 
#tables
+--------------------------------+
| Tables_in_tango                |
+--------------------------------+
| ...                            |
| history_ids                    |
| property_attribute_class_hist  |
| property_attribute_device_hist |
| property_class_hist            |
| property_device_hist           |
| property_hist                  |
| ...                            |
+--------------------------------+

#Note: If your database server stops with the following exception,that means 
#that you don't have the correct scheme.

Received a CORBA::Exception
Tango exception
Severity = ERROR
Error reason = DB_SQLError
Desc : Failed to query TANGO database (error=Table 'tango.property_device_hist' doesn't exist)
Origin : DataBase::check_history_tables()

#If you don't have the history scheme:
#Use the db_init_history program to create/initialise history tables.
#This program will create and fill the history tables with the current 
#dababase property values (to initialize the first value of the 
#property history). This tool does not affect old tables, that means 
#that even if you run this tool, you will still be able to launch
#an old release of the DB server.

db_init_history [user] [password]

#Now, you should be able to launch the DB server

Databaseds 2 -ORBendPoint giop:tcp:[hostname]:[port]

#To test if the DB server is working fine, you can launch jive

export TANGO_HOST=[hostname]:[port]
jive


------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to change the history depth (Number of value kept in the property history)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can set the property history depth by setting the "historyDepth" device 
property of the DB server. The default value is 10.
Note that you have to launch the DB server in order to be able to configure 
this property with Jive and then to restart the DB server to take change into
account.
